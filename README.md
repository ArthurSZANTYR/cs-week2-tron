We realized this project as part of a week of computer science courses, we had to make a network game in the format of "*Tron light racer*".

> Light Cycles is a video game created by Kevin Flynn. The game is played by driving a vehicle known as a light cycle, which leaves an impenetrable barrier called a Jetwall. The object of the game is to make all of the other opponents drive into the jetwall, effectively derezzing the cycle. The last person still on their cycle is the winner.

The instructions were to use sockets and multi threading to make this game work

## Installation and Usage
To use the game follow these steps :
* Open the file "Server.py" 
  * Choose the number of players in the "Hand"
  * Put the right ip that will host the server the time of the part "host = "x.x.x.x""
  * Put a chosen port "port = xxxx"
* Open a "Client.py" file by desired players
  * Put the right ip that host the server "host = "x.x.x.x""
  * Put the right port "port = xxxx"

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Code_Phased_Array_Speaker_esp_idf` directory contains the main application code
- `Kicad_Phased_Array_Speaker` directory contains the hardware schematics and PCB layout files
